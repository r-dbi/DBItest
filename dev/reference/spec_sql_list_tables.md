spec_sql_list_tables

## Value

`dbListTables()` returns a character vector that enumerates all tables
and views in the database. Tables added with
[`DBI::dbWriteTable()`](https://dbi.r-dbi.org/reference/dbWriteTable.html)
are part of the list. As soon a table is removed from the database, it
is also removed from the list of database tables.

The same applies to temporary tables if supported by the database.

The returned names are suitable for quoting with `dbQuoteIdentifier()`.

## Failure modes

An error is raised when calling this method for a closed or invalid
connection.

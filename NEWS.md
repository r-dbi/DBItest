# DBItest 1.7.1 (2021-07-30)

## Features

- Many tests now emit simpler stack traces, because the connection is opened by the test driver and not by the test itself (#187). Reduce usage of `with_remove_test_table()` for better stack traces on error (#196). Remove `with_*connection()` (#193).
- `test_some()` shows DBI code via dblog (#217) if `dblog = TRUE` (#226).

- `"roundtrip_time"` and `"append_roundtrip_time"` tests now also test values of class `"difftime"` with units other than `"secs"` (#199).
- All tables created by the tests have the `"dbit"` prefix. Almost all tests now use random table names to avoid collisions and unrelated test failures (#197).
- `"roundtrip_timestamp"` tests now accept a time zone set by the database backend (#178, #198).
- Support more than one class of each type in DBI backend packages.

## Bug fixes

- Fix input dataset in `"overwrite_table_missing"` test (#210, @martinstuder).
- Use original test name to decide if a test is skipped (#225).

## Internal

- Requires DBI 1.1.1.
- Test odbc as part of the backend tests (#228).
- Dynamic build matrix for backends (#221).
- Compatibility with testthat 3.0.0 (#207).
- Switch to GitHub Actions (#201).

# DBItest 1.7.0 (2019-12-16)

## Specifications

- Specify tests for `dbGetInfo()`.
- Specify `immediate` argument (r-dbi/DBI#268).
- Specify `dbCreateTable()` and `dbAppendTable()` (#169).
- New `unquote_identifier_table_schema` test: Identifiers of the form `table.schema` can be processed with `dbUnquoteIdentifier()`.
- Fix `has_completed_statement` test (#176).

## Testing infrastructure

- Document how to run tests externally and how to debug tests (#165).
- `test_*()` gain new `run_only = NULL` argument that allow restricting the tests to be run with a positive match. `test_some()` uses `run_only` instead of constructing a regular expression with negative lookahead. This helps troubleshooting a single test with `testthat::set_reporter(DebugReporter$new())` .
- `make_context()` gains `default_skip` argument and uses the `DBIConnector` class.
- Support `NULL` default value in driver constructor (#171).

## Internal

- Fulfill CII badge requirements (#179, @TSchiefer).
- Use debugme.
- Require R 3.2.
- Avoid subsetting vectors out of bounds, for consistency with vctrs.



# DBItest 1.6.0 (2018-05-03)

## New checks

- Now checking that `Id()` is reexported.
- Support `temporary` argument in `dbRemoveTable()` (default: `FALSE`) (r-dbi/DBI#141).
- Added specification for the behavior in case of duplicate column names (#137).
- The `bigint` argument to `dbConnect()` is now specified. Accepts `"integer64"`, `"integer"`, `"numeric"` and `"character"`, large integers are returned as values of that type (#133).
- Add specification for partially filled `field.types` argument.
- Specify `dbRemoveTable(fail_if_missing = FALSE)` (r-dbi/DBI#197).
- Add specification for `dbColumnInfo()` (r-dbi/DBI#75).
- Add specification for `dbListFields()` (r-dbi/DBI#75).
- Test that named parameters are actually matched by name in `dbBind()`, by shuffling them (#138).
- Explicitly specify default `row.names = FALSE` for `dbReadTable()` and `dbWriteTable()` (#139).
- Add specification for writing 64-bit values, backends must support roundtripping values returned from the database (#146).
- Add specification for the `params` argument to `dbGetQuery()`, `dbSendQuery()`, `dbExecute()` and `dbSendStatement()` (#159).
- Add test for `dbQuoteIdentifier()`: "The names of the input argument are preserved in the output" (r-lib/DBI#173).
- Blob tests now also read and write zero bytes (\x00).
- Add string encoded in Latin-1 to the character tests.
- Added test for `dbIsValid()` on stale connections.

## Removed checks

- Don't test selecting untyped `NULL` anymore.
- Full interface compliance doesn't require a method for `dbGetInfo(DBIDriver)` for now.
- Remove `"cannot_forget_disconnect"` test that fails on R-devel (#150).
- Methods without `db` prefix are not checked for ellipsis in the signature anymore.
- Don't specify `Inf` and `NaN` for lack of consistent support across DBMS (#142).

## Updated/corrected checks

- Fix query that is supposed to generate a syntax error.
- Fix typo (#147, @jonmcalder).
- Implement `POSIXlt` bind test correctly.
- Improve error detection for `dbBind()`.
- Redesign tests for `dbBind()`, now queries of the form `SELECT CASE WHEN (? = ?) AND (? IS NULL) THEN 1.5 ELSE 2.5` are issued. The original tests were inappropriate for RMariaDB, because an untyped placeholder is returned as a blob.
- Transaction tests now use `dbWriteTable()` instead of `dbCreateTable()`, because some DBMS don't support transactions for DML.
- Fix timestamp tests for RMariaDB.
- Fix string constants.
- The `"roundtrip_timestamp"` test now correctly handles timezone information. The output timezone is ignored.
- Clear result in `spec_meta_get_info_result` (#143).
- Use named argument for `n` in `dbGetQuery()` call.
- Minor fixes.

## Tweaks

- New tweak `blob_cast` allows specifying a conversion function to the BLOB data type.
- New `is_null_check` tweak that allows specifying a function that is used when checking values for `NULL`. Required for RPostgres.
- New `list_temporary_tables` tweak that can be enabled independently of `temporary_tables` to indicate that the DBMS does not support listing temporary tables.

## Infrastructure

- Allow running only a subset of tests in `test_all()` by specifying an environment variable.
- `test_all()` and `test_some()` return `NULL` invisibly.

## Internals

- Compatibility code if `DBI::dbQuoteLiteral()` is unavailable.
- New `trivial_query()` replaces many hard-coded queries and uses non-integer values for better compatibility with RMariaDB.
- Convert factor to character for iris data (#141).

# DBItest 1.5-2 (2018-01-26)

- Fix test that fails with "noLD".
- Fix NOTEs on R-devel.


# DBItest 1.5-1 (2017-12-10)

- Remove `"cannot_forget_disconnect"` test that fails on R-devel (#150).


# DBItest 1.5 (2017-06-18)

- Test that `dbFetch()` on update-only query returns warning (#66).

Adapted tests
-------------

- `NULL` is a valid value for the `row.names` argument, same as `FALSE`.
- A column named `row_names` receives no special handling (#54).
- A warning (not an error anymore) is expected when calling `dbDisconnect()` on a closed or invalid connection.
- `row.names = FALSE` is now the default for methods that read or write tables.
- Add `NA` to beginning and end of columns in table roundtrip tests (#24).
- Stricter tests for confusion of named and unnamed SQL parameters and placeholders (#107).
- Also check names of all returned data frames.
- The return value for all calls to `dbGetQuery()`, `dbFetch()`, and `dbReadTable()` is now checked for consistency (all columns have the same length, length matches number of rows) (#126).
- Removed stress tests that start a new session.
- Allow `hms` (or other subclasses of `difftime`) to be returned as time class (#135, @jimhester).
- Test that dates are of type `numeric` (#99, @jimhester).

- The `logical_return`, `date_typed` and `timestamp_typed` tweaks are respected by the bind tests.
- Fixed tests involving time comparison; now uses UTC timezone and compares against a `difftime`.
- Tests for roundtrip of character values now includes tabs, in addition to many other special characters (#85).
- Make sure at least one table exists in the `dbListTables()` test.
- Fix roundtrip tests for raw columns: now expecting `NULL` and not `NA` entries for SQL NULL values.
- Fix `expect_equal_df()` for list columns.
- Testing that a warning is given if the user forgets to call `dbDisconnect()` or `dbClearResult()` (#103).
- Numeric roundtrip accepts conversion of `NaN` to `NA` (#79).

Internal
--------

- Fix R CMD check errors.
- Internal consistency checks (#114).
- Skip patterns that don't match any of the tests now raise a warning (#84).
- New `test_some()` to test individual tests (#136).
- Use desc instead of devtools (#40).
- All unexpected warnings are now reported as test failures (#113).
- `DBItest_tweaks` class gains a `$` method, accessing an undefined tweak now raises an error.
- The arguments of the `tweaks()` function now have default values that further describe their intended usage.
- New `with_closed_connection(ctx = ctx, )`, `with_invalid_connection(ctx = ctx, )`, `with_result()` and `with_remove_test_table()` helpers, and `expect_visible()`, `expect_inbisible_true()`, and `expect_equal_df()` expectations for more concise tests.


# DBItest 1.4 (2016-12-02)

## DBI specification

- Use markdown in documentation.
- Description of parametrized queries and statements (#88).
- New hidden `DBIspec-wip` page for work-in-progress documentation.
- Get rid of "Format" and "Usage" sections, and aliases, in the specs.

## Tests

- Not testing for presence of `max.connections` element in `dbGetInfo(Driver)` (rstats-db/DBI#56).
- Test multi-row binding for queries and statements (#96).
- New `ellipsis` check that verifies that all implemented DBI methods contain `...` in their formals. This excludes `show()` and all methods defined in this or other packages.
- Refactored `bind_` tests to use the new `parameter_pattern` tweak (#95).
- Rough draft of transaction tests (#36).

- Minor corrections for "bind" tests.

## Internal

- Isolate stress tests from main test suite (#92).
- Refactor test specification in smaller modules, isolated from actual test execution (#81). This breaks the documentation of the tests, which will be substituted by a DBI specification in prose.
- Align description of binding with code.
- Refactor tests for `dbBind()`, test is run by `BindTester` class, and behavior is specified by members and by instances of the new `BindTesterExtra` class.
- The `skip` argument to the `test_()` functions is again evaluated with `perl = TRUE` to support negative lookaheads (#33).
- Use `dbSendStatement()` and `dbExecute()` where appropriate.

# DBItest 1.2 (2016-05-21)

- Infrastructure
    - Support names for contexts (@hoesler, #67).
    - The `skip` argument to the test functions is now treated as a Perl regular expression to allow negative lookahead. Use `skip = "(?!test_regex).*"` to choose a single test to run (#33).
    - Added encoding arguments to non-ASCII string constants (#60, @hoesler).
- Improve tests
    - `simultaneous_connections` test always closes all connections on exit (@hoesler, #68).

Version 1.1 (2016-02-12)
===

- New feature: tweaks
    - New argument `tweaks` to `make_context()` (#49).
    - New `tweaks()`, essentially constructs a named list of tweaks but with predefined and documented argument names.
    - `constructor_name`, respected by the `constructor.*` tests.
    - `strict_identifier`, if `TRUE` all identifier must be syntactic names even if quoted. The quoting test is now split, and a part is ignored conditional to this tweak. The `roundtrip_quotes` tests also respects this tweak.
    - `omit_blob_tests` for DBMS that don't have a BLOB data type.
    - `current_needs_parens` -- some SQL dialects (e.g., BigQuery) require parentheses for the functions `current_date`, `current_time` and `current_timestamp`.
    - `union`, for specifying a nonstandard way of combining queries. All union queries now name each column in each subquery (required for `bigrquery`).
- New tests
    - `dbGetInfo(Result)` (rstats-db/DBI#55).
    - `dbListFields()` (#26).
    - New `package_name` test in `test_getting_started()`.
- Improved tests
    - Stress test now installs package in temporary library (before loading `DBI`) using `R CMD INSTALL` before loading DBI (rstats-db/RSQLite#128, #48).
    - Row count is now tested for equality but not identity, so that backends can return a numeric value > 2^31 at their discretion.
    - Call `dbRemoveTable()` instead of issuing `DROP` requests, the latter might be unsupported.
    - Use subqueries in queries that use `WHERE`.
    - Test that `dbClearResult()` on a closed result set raises a warning.
    - Expect a warning instead of an error for double disconnect (#50).
    - Move connection test that requires `dbFetch()` to `test_result()`.
    - Split `can_connect_and_disconnect` test.
    - Expect `DBI` to be in `Imports`, not in `Depends`.
- Removed tests
    - Remove test for `dbGetException()` (rstats-db/DBI#51).
- Bug fixes
    - Fix broken tests for quoting.
- Self-testing
    - Test `RPostgres`, `RMySQL`, `RSQLite` and `RKazam` as part of the Travis-CI tests (#52).
    - Travis CI now installs rstats-db/DBI, updated namespace imports (`dbiCheckCompliance()`, `dbListResults()`).
    - Use fork of `testthat`.
- Utilities
    - Return test results as named array of logical. Requires hadley/testthat#360, gracefully degrades with the CRAN version.
- Internal
    - Refactored the `get_info_()` tests to use a vector of names.
